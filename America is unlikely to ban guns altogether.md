  As is known to all ,gun control is always a heated issue in USA.The first statement with respect to it is the second amendment to the constitution of USA，which committed the right to keep and bear guns to people in USA.Furthermore this right had been elaborated by the subsequent Supreme Court Decision on Heller Case.

  I am a firm supporter of gun control.However ,in America it is impossible to have comprehensively guns prohibited.

  First ,people need guns to protect their rights while facing some emergencies like robbery and murder.USA is such a low-population-density country .In most places police can not provide people guard for abrupt criminals in time .What’s more the case of warren v. district of columbia appeals the police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to citizens based on the duty doctrine.So it’s necessary for people in such places to bear guns to defend their rights.

  Second,the right to keep and bear gun is an invisible deterrence to violent criminal.As we all know the criminal always choose people lacking ability offend themselves to execute criminal. As what I said before it really keep many people from the harm of criminals.Moreover its deterrence counts as well.It’s hard to count the number of criminal which are deterred by guns.

  Last but not least, there is no doubt that gun brings side effects. There are almost 40 thousand people killed by guns every year .The number should not be ignored by us .So it’s critical for the government to take effective measures to control illegal guns.

  All in all,gun prohibition is impossible in the USA for its irreplaceable effect on defend citizens rights.But the appropriate control is imperative.
